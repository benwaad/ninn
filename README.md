# Numerics-informed neural networks and inverse problems with hyperbolic balance laws

This repository was created to support my Master's thesis *Numerics-informed neural networks and inverse problems with hyperbolic balance laws* with numerical experiments and visualizations.
The thesis was written during the spring of 2023 under the supervision of Kjetil Olsen Lye at Sintef.

## Contents

The contents of the repository is organized in folders corresponding to the different sections of the thesis.
The code is written in Python, mostly using the PyTorch framework for automatic differentiation.

## Word of advice

The code in files named `plot` or `train` are generally very specialized, and may not be easily applicable to different usecases.
However, the code in files named `flux`, `models`, and `tools` are abstract enough to be reused.
